## Teaching Experience 
I serve as Peer Learning Assistant (PLA) for the Mathematical Sciences Department at WPI. This entails:
1. Manage a section of 20 to 35 students in mathematical sciences courses at WPI
2. Run a weekly discussion section reviewing lecture content. 
3. Grade Homework & exams for the section working with a Professor and other PLAs and Teaching Assistants.
*Courses Taught:*
- MA 1023 - Calculus III, A Term 2020, A Term 2021, D Term 2022
- MA 2071 - Matrices & Linear Algebra I - B Term 2020, D Term 2021
- MA 2621 - Probability for Applications, C Term 2022
- MA 3231 - Linear Programming, A Term 2022

## Leadership
- President, WPI Math Club (April 2020 - Present)
	- Prepare meetings for WPIâ€™s math club by finding an activity for our weekly math hour. Normally this consists of a fun puzzle with a mathematical bend that the club discusses and tries to solve.
- President, WPI Pi Mu Epsilon Massachusetts Alpha Math Honors Society (May 2022 - Present)
	 - Vice President January 2022 - May 2022, Member April 2021 - January 2022
