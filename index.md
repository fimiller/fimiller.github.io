## About Me

I am a PhD Student at Northeastern University Department of Mathematics in the [Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab (NEURAL)](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/) under Professor David Rosen. I am interested in exploring the depths of mathematical optimization and its applications. In particular, I am exploring developing efficient algorithms to solve semi-algebraic optimization problems that arise in machine intelligence.

Outside of mathematics, I like watching movies and going hiking through New England.

## Education
- PhD in Mathematics, Northeastern University. Fall 2023 - Present

- Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), August 2019 - May 2023. GPA: 3.92/4.0
- Bachelor of Science in Data Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), August 2019 - May 2023. GPA: 3.92/4.0
	- Major Qualifying Project (MQP) (Senior Thesis): ["Deep Learning for Reflected Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations"](https://digital.wpi.edu/concern/student_works/js956j933?locale=en), Advisor: Stephan Sturm. Awarded MQP Departmental Honorable Mention


## Research Interests
My current research involves developing novel algorithms to solve large scale semialgebraic optimization problems. Towards this effort, I was awarded the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP)](https://nsfgrfp.org/). To get a flavor of my research, check out my ["research proposal"](./assets/grfp_proposal.pdf) to the GRFP! In short, we hope to develop algorithms and software that can take a large scale polynomial optimization problem and construct and solve its associated SDP relaxation. One  key technique we are applying is the Lasserre / Sum of Squares hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems, which is a tool for solving polynomial optimization problems through a sequence of semidefinite relaxations.

In addition, I am particularly interested in developing solutions where the problem data may be contaminated with outliers. Currently, many algorithms are brittle to outliers, but we hope to bridge this gap by developing robust algorithms for these problems.  

As an undegraduate, I conducted research in public sector operations research. This involved applying mixed integer linear fractional programming to the problem of marginal shelter deployment for a city. Additionally, I researched deep learning techniques for determining the solution to a certain class of stochastic differential equations for the problem of option pricing in mathematical finance.
