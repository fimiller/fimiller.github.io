## About Me

I am a PhD Student at Northeastern University Department of Mathematics in the [Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab (NEURAL)](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/) under Professor David Rosen. I am interested in exploring the depths of mathematical optimization and its applications. Outside of mathematics, I like watching movies and going hiking through New England.
